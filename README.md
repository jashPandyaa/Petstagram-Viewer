# Petstagram-Viewer

🐾 Project 1 – Petstagram Viewer (Cats & Dogs Edition)
Created a pet-themed web app that displays Instagram-like profiles for cats and dogs using dynamic routes like /ig/cats and /ig/dogs.

The app reads profile data from a local data.json file and shows a custom "No account exists" message for any other username entered.

Configured EJS as the view engine and organized all templates in a dedicated views folder for clean server-side rendering.

Set up simple routing logic to handle each profile page and display custom images, followers, and post details dynamically.

Also added basic frontend styling and structure using HTML and CSS to make the interface more user-friendly and clean.
